Following on from last week's home win over Getafe, the Whites secured a convincing 4-1 triumph over Girona in their first away game of the season. The Madrid goals came from Karim Benzema (twice), Sergio Ramos and Bale as the madridistas came from behind after Borja García had put the hosts in front. With two wins to their name, six goals for and one against, Julen Lopetegui's men sit top of the pile ahead of the final two games of the matchday.

				<p class="article_para">
					<strong>I</strong>t has been six years since Luka Modric checked in at Real Madrid. Since his arrival on 27 August 2012, the Croatian schemer has been an instrumental figure in one of the most successful periods in the club's history. His impressive trophy haul speaks volumes of the role he's played: he has claimed no fewer than 14 trophies as a madridista (four Champions League crowns, three Club World Cups, three UEFA Super Cups, a LaLiga title, one Copa del Rey and two Spanish Super Cups). Modric made his bow two days after his unveiling and quite some debut it was, as Madrid overcome Barcelona to secure the Spanish Super Cup.The Golden Ball honour at the Russia World Cup.
